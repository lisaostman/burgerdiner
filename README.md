# Burger Diner

## The Short Version:
This works using node as a small application where you can 'order' and 'devour' your favourite burgers.

## More in-depth user control:
 * Utilises mySQL, Jaws as a heroku add-on, handlebars and models to create an application
 * Users can create new burgers in the database
 * They can then update their status to devoured or to be consumed
